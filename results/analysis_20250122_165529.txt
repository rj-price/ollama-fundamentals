Jordan Price \n\nWebsite:  \n\nrjprice.bio \n\nGitHub:  \n\ngithub.com/rj-price \n\nProfessional Profile \n\nHighly skilled bioinformatician and molecular biologist with a background in functional genomics across diverse \nspecies. Over a decade of molecular biology expertise coupled with 5+ years of hands-on bioinformatics experience. \nDemonstrated expertise in genomics, comparative analysis, and data-driven research. From sample preparation and \nsequencing to computational analyses, I bring a comprehensive  biological understanding to the implementation of \ninformative genomic data. Adept at leading projects, managing teams, and providing guidance to colleagues. Seeking a \nfull-time bioinformatics position to further apply and expand upon this experience and contribute to innovative \nprojects. \n\nSkills \n\n•  Proficient using several NGS data pipelines (including WGS, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq) \n•  Experience utilising long (ONT) and short (Illumina) read datasets, including quality control \n•  Comfortable coding in Python, Bash, and R \n•  Familiar with data visualisation packages (matplotlib, seaborn, ggplot2) \n•  Proficient working in Linux and Slurm-based HPC environments \n•  Working knowledge of Nextflow pipeline management, including nf-core and DSL2 features \n•  Use of version control software (git) \n•  Familiar with containerisation (Docker, Singularity) \n\nWork Experience \n\n2022  – Present \n\nSenior Specialist, Cambridge Crop Research, NIAB \n\n•  Utilising whole genome sequencing and variant analysis pipelines, transcriptomics, and CRISPR based \n\ndeletion and base editing to identify candidate genes responsible for hyper-branching phenotype in the \nQuorn mycoprotein fungus Fusarium venenatum. \n\n•  Regularly engaging with project partners, providing summary reports and visualisations of complex data, to \n\n• \n\nensure that we are meeting project milestones and delivering high-quality results. \nInvolvement in several side projects, including the assembly, annotation, and comparative analysis of \nraspberry cultivars and fungal pathogens.  \n\n•  Training other lab members in the analysis of RNA-seq datasets and genome assembly methods. \n\n2020  – 2022 \n2019  – 2020 \n\nSpecialist, Cambridge Crop Research, NIAB \nSpecialist, Genetics, Genomics and Breeding, NIAB EMR \n\n•  Used comparative genomics to investigate the evolutionary underpinnings of actinorhizal nitrogen fixing \n\nsymbiosis, both from the host plant and bacterial symbiont perspectives.  \n\n•  Carried out sequencing, assembly and annotation of several plant and bacterial genomes. \n•  Performed comparative analyses across phylogenies to identify orthologs, gene presence/absence, and cis-\nregulatory elements involved in actinorhizal symbiosis that are now being used to further engineering \nstrategies. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\x0c2015  – 2019 \n\nPostdoctoral Research Associate, School of Biosciences, University of Kent \n\n•  Explored the epigenetic and genomic modifications underpinning the pathogenicity of the human fungal \n\n• \n\npathogen Candida albicans. \nImplemented and optimised a novel quantitative ChIP-seq method in Candida albicans, performed \ncomputational analysis of resulting datasets. \n\n•  Created novel deletion strains to explore the genomic modifications underpinning the pathogenicity of a \n\nhuman fungal pathogen and analysed RNA-seq datasets resulting from these strains. \n\n2012  – 2015 \n\nPostdoctoral Research Fellow, Faculty of Medicine, University of Southampton  \n\n•  Designed and performed high throughput multiplex TaqMan qPCR assays, Western blot optimisation and \nanalysis, and computational analysis of expression microarray and DNA methylation data to determine the \nrole of BRCA1 and BRCA2 in a variety of cancer and primary human cell lines. \n\nManagement Responsibilities \n\nI am currently responsible for the management of research project budgets, communication with project partners, \nand efficient allocation of resources to ensure timely completion of milestones. Throughout my time at NIAB, I have \nline managed four research technicians and two postdoctoral researchers and have co-supervised three \npostgraduate students. I also assist with the day-to-day supervision of junior lab members. \n\nEducation \n\n2008  – 2012 \n2007  – 2008   \n2004  – 2007   \n\nPhD in Developmental Biology, University of Portsmouth \nMSc (by research) in Biomedical Science, Lancaster University \nBSc Biochemistry (2:1), Lancaster University \n\nSelected Publications \n\n•  Bates, H.
